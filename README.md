# Common Library for Algorithms and Data Structure in Java

### Algorithms
| Type                | Algorithm Names                                                    |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Sorting             | QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, CountingSort.                      |
| Searching           | Binary Search, Interpolation Search.                               |
| Dynamic Programming | Longest Common Subsequence, Knapsack, Matrix Chain Multiplication. |
| Graph Algorithms:   | BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall.                |
| String Manipulation | KMP Algorithm, Rabin-Karp, Z Algorithm.                            |

### Data Structures
* Arrays 
* Linked Lists (single, doubly) 
* Stacks 
* Queues (circular, priority) 
* Binary Search Trees 
* Hash Maps 
* Graphs 
  * Tries
  For each data structure, provide essential operations (insert, delete, search, update).
